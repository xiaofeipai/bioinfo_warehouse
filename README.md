# introduction
The bioinfo_warehouse stores codes about bioinformational algorithms. Now it includes sequence alignment. Soon i will update the code and implement my algorithms. If you don't understand the details of them, you can see my articles in zhihu.Here is the link.

## pair_align_dna
This algorithm is used for find out the similiar sequences in dna, which can help us to design the primer in PCR or find the similiar genes between organisms. 

## mystring
I don't want to use string class in C++, because I want to insert some functions.
